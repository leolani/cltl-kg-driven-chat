"""
Shared classes for the chat_session.ipynb / kg_chat_session.ipynb notebooks.

- ChatSession: a live or scripted conversation between a human (a diabetes patient) and an
  agent (a lifestyle coach), turned into the flat turn schema described in chat_session.ipynb.
- KgChatSession(ChatSession): the same, but every turn is also run through SRL extraction and
  pushed into a knowledge graph, with the agent's reply drawn from a knowledge-graph gap when
  one is available. See kg_chat_session.ipynb for the full per-turn flow.

KgChatSession's own dependencies (events_from_chat, chat_from_kg -- cltl.brain, rdflib,
transformers/torch via perspective/emotion_extraction.py, and OPENAI_API_KEY read at *import*
time) are only loaded on first use (_load_kg_dependencies(), called from KgChatSession.__init__),
so `from chat_sessions import ChatSession` alone -- as chat_session.ipynb does -- never pays for
any of that.

    Input, Output} dicts, Output still the raw SRLAnnotation Pydantic objects). self.kg_pushes
    holds one populate_ekg_from_annotations() summary per turn actually pushed to the graph
    (turns with no extractions produce neither). self.reply_sources holds one "gap" / "default" /
    "timeout" tag per agent reply, so you can see which replies came from a knowledge-graph gap,
    a generic LLM reply, or a step that timed out (see ChatTimeoutError/say()'s own docstring).

    Gap questions are drawn from self._gap_queues (per-activity-instance queues of gaps still to
    ask about) and never repeat a gap already recorded in self._asked_gap_keys -- see
    _next_gap()/_reply_from_gaps(). When the gap just asked about was an agent/agent_patient
    confirmation (see prompts.response_processor.get_prompt_for_agent_gap()), self._pending_confirmation
    holds it until the human's very next turn, which is then routed to
    _handle_confirmation_reply() instead of the normal annotate-and-push flow -- see say().

    self.last_subject_uris holds the KG subject URI(s) most recently touched by a push -- the
    human turn's own extraction (say()) or a confirmation-driven push (_push_gap_triple()) --
    kept unchanged on a turn that pushes nothing, so it always names the activity most relevant
    right now. Read by kg_chat_gui.py's graph panel to know which activity to display/link to;
    of no interest if you're not driving this session through that GUI.

    self.gap_activity_types (see DEFAULT_GAP_ACTIVITY_TYPES) restricts gap-finding to activities
    of an allow-listed type -- a turn's own new subjects are still pushed to the graph and still
    update self.last_subject_uris either way, but only the eligible ones (_is_gap_eligible_type())
    are ever passed to _reply_from_gaps()/_fetch_gap_queue(), so an activity of some other type
    never gets a gap-driven follow-up question. None disables the restriction (every type is
    eligible). self._subject_types (subject_uri -> its type's local name, populated as a side
    effect of _annotate_and_push()) is what that check reads.

    self.turn_log holds one diagnostic entry per turn (both the human's and the agent's, same
    turns/indexing as self.turns), each a
    {"turn", "speaker", "utterance", "triples_pushed", "gap_queries", "selected_gap"} dict:
      - triples_pushed: a simplified [{"subject", "predicate", "object"}, ...] view of what THIS
        turn told the knowledge graph (see _extraction_log_triples()) -- NOT the exact RDF (see
        events_to_capsules.py for that), just enough to see at a glance what was asserted.
      - gap_queries: one [{"subject", "threshold", "found", "after_dedup"}, ...] entry per FRESH
        kg_gap_finder query actually run while producing this turn's reply (empty if none was --
        e.g. an already-queued gap was used instead, see _next_gap(), or this is the agent's own
        turn, which never triggers gap-finding at all).
      - selected_gap: the {"subject", "predicate", "kind", "peer_coverage"} gap this turn's reply
        was about -- freshly found this turn, or (for a turn that answers a pending confirmation)
        the one being resolved -- or None if the reply wasn't gap-driven at all.
    Printed as each entry is built when LOG_TURNS is True (the module default); always populated
    into self.turn_log regardless. kg_chat_gui.py's save_session() writes it to a third JSON file

    at the project root, see chat_from_kg/intent_gap_finder.py) instead of kg_gap_finder's
    peer-statistics-based gaps -- see kg_intent_chat.ipynb for the full per-turn flow.

    kg_gap_finder's own gaps only fire once a MAJORITY of an activity's peers already have the
    predicate in question, so the very first "take_food" activity ever pushed to the graph can
    never produce one -- intents state what's expected directly, independent of how many similar
    activities already exist, which is exactly why this exists as a separate session class
    rather than just a different gap_activity_types/gap_threshold on KgChatSession.

    Only _is_gap_eligible_type(), _fetch_gap_queue() and _print_log_entry() (for its
    differently-shaped turn_log "gap_queries" entries -- no peer_coverage/threshold, since
    there's no peer voting here) differ from KgChatSession; everything else -- annotating and
    pushing turns to the graph, agent-confirmation handling, timeouts, the rest of turn_log --
    is unchanged, since a filled-in intent gap is annotated back onto the graph exactly the same
    way an ordinary kg_gap_finder gap's answer is (the human's plain-text reply to the follow-up
    question runs through the normal incremental extractor next turn -- see the class docstring
    on cross-turn coreference); nothing here needs its own push path.

    self.intents holds the loaded intent definitions (see intent_gap_finder.load_intents()) --
    an activity type NOT covered by any of them (intent_gap_finder.find_intent() returns None)
    is simply never gap-driven: its turns are still annotated/pushed to the graph like any
    other, but the agent's reply for it always falls back to the plain LLM agent_fn -- "if there
    is no intent match, use the LLM response". This includes the case where several intents
    share one activity_type (see this project's own symptom_intents.json, where several
    different symptoms all share the generic "symptom" ActivityType) but the activity's own
    label -- self._subject_labels, inherited from KgChatSession -- doesn't match any of the
    matching intents' "activity_labels": find_intent() deliberately treats that as no match too,
    rather than guessing one of them (see its own docstring).
