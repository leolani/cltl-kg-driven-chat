kg_chat_gui.py
===============
A single-window Tkinter chat UI for driving a `ChatSession` / `KgChatSession`
(chat_sessions.py), as an alternative to `ChatSession.run_interactive()`'s
terminal `input()` loop.

- The whole conversation (both the human's and the agent's turns) is shown scrolling in one
  window, instead of being interleaved into the notebook's cell output.
- The human types their line into an entry box built into the bottom of that *same* window --
  there's no separate popup/dialog for input, and no terminal `input()` prompt.
- Every agent turn is tagged **[KG]** or **[LLM]** so it's visible at a glance whether that
  reply came from a knowledge-graph gap question or the default LLM reply -- read from
  `session.reply_sources` (one "gap"/"default"/"timeout" entry per agent turn, appended by
  `KgChatSession.say()`; see chat_sessions.py). A plain `ChatSession` has no `reply_sources`
  attribute at all, so every one of its agent turns is just tagged **[LLM]** (its only kind of
  reply) rather than left unlabeled. A "timeout" turn is also shown as **[LLM]** (it isn't a KG
  gap question) -- its actual message text is what tells you an OpenAI call timed out and names
  which step; see chat_sessions.ChatTimeoutError.
- For a `KgChatSession` (anything with a `gap_threshold` attribute), a "Gap sensitivity" slider
  lets `gap_threshold` be adjusted live, mid-conversation, instead of only at construction time --
  see `_on_gap_threshold_change()`. Not shown for a plain `ChatSession`, which has no such thing.
- Quitting -- the **Quit** button, a quit word, or the window manager's close button -- writes the
  conversation and a statistics summary out as timestamped JSON files (`save_session()` /
  `session_statistics()`) -- plus, for a `KgChatSession`, its turn-by-turn gap log
  (`chat_sessions.KgChatSession.turn_log`) as a third file -- and prints their paths, before
  tearing the window down.
- When `session.kg_address` points at a GraphDB repository (`.../repositories/<id>`), the window
  splits into two panes: the chat on the left (everything above), and a **graph panel** on the
  right drawing the activity the conversation is currently about as an actual node-link diagram
  -- the activity as one centered node, every (predicate, object) triple pushed for it as a
  labeled edge fanning out to its own node, except `rdfs:label` triples (the label value is
  already what the center node's own text shows, so repeating it as a separate
  "label -> <that same text>" node/edge would just be clutter) and `gaf:denotedIn`/`denotedBy`
  triples (`GAF_PROVENANCE_PREDICATES`: pure extraction provenance -- which utterance span a
  fact came from -- not semantic content, and typically several per subject) -- neither is ever
  drawn as its own node -- rendered directly on a `tk.Canvas`, entirely in-window, no browser
  involved (see the graph-panel section below and `_render_graph()`). Every
  node is filled by its RDF namespace (`_namespace_of()`/`_node_fill_color()`): red for `n2mu`,
  blue for `gaf`, green for `grasp` (this project's own ontology namespaces -- see
  `NAMESPACE_COLORS`), a plain literal (not a URI at all) gray, and any other namespace one of
  `OTHER_NAMESPACE_PALETTE`'s colors, assigned the first time it's seen and kept for the life of
  the window -- a small legend under the activity dropdown shows what's what. A dropdown lists
  every activity mentioned so far (most recent first) so you can switch which one's drawn; an
  **"Open in GraphDB ↗"** button is still there for the *real*, fully interactive D3 view (drag
  nodes, expand further, ...) in the system's default browser when that's wanted -- same URL
  shape as GraphDB's own UI:
  `<base>/graphs-visualizations?uri=<activity>&role=context&repositoryId=<repo>`. Not built at
  all for a plain `ChatSession`, or a `kg_address` that isn't a GraphDB repository URL
  (`graphdb_base_and_repository()` returns `(None, None)` and the panel is simply skipped).
- Two independent font-size sliders, both starting at `DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE` (16pt): **"Text size"**
  (always shown) scales the transcript/entry/buttons/status line together -- built on named
  `tkinter.font.Font` objects (`self.chat_font`/`chat_font_bold`/`chat_font_italic`) that every
  one of those widgets/tags references directly, so reconfiguring just their `size` live-resizes
  everything at once, already-inserted transcript text included, no re-insertion needed. The
  graph panel's own **"Font size"** slider (only when the panel exists) instead re-runs
  `_render_graph()` on its already-cached data at the new size -- canvas text items don't
  auto-resize the way Text-widget-tagged text does -- so this, like a resize, costs no network
  round-trip; node/center circle radii scale roughly *proportionally* with it (not by a small
  fixed add-on), so a node's label keeps roughly the same amount of room -- and wraps onto
  roughly the same number of lines -- at any size on the slider, instead of the circle staying
  about the same size while the text inside it keeps growing.

Usage (from a notebook, in place of `kg_session.run_interactive()`):
    from chat_sessions import KgChatSession
    from kg_chat_gui import run_gui

    kg_session = KgChatSession(chat=..., human=..., kg_address=..., ...)
    kg_turns = run_gui(kg_session)   # opens the window, blocks until it's closed

Talking to the graph/LLM happens on a background thread per turn (SPARQL pushes, gap lookups
and OpenAI calls can each take a few seconds -- occasionally longer, if a call hangs outright),
so the window stays responsive; only the resulting Tk widget updates are marshalled back onto
the main thread via `root.after()`, since Tkinter itself isn't thread-safe. The entry box is
never disabled while a reply is in flight, and a quit word (see `quit_words`, e.g. "bye") is
checked before anything else in `_on_send()` -- so the window always closes right away when you
say bye, even if the previous reply is still pending or never comes back. The "Quit" button next
to Send does the same thing (calls the same _on_close()) and, unlike Send, is never disabled
either -- a one-click way out that needs no typing. `_on_close()` calls `root.quit()` before
`root.destroy()`: destroy() alone tears down the widgets but doesn't reliably end a mainloop()
that IPython/Jupyter is driving or nesting, which left the window on screen and the notebook
cell hanging even after Quit was pressed.

Needs Tkinter (part of the Python standard library on most installs; on some Linux/pyenv
builds it needs a separate `python3-tk` / `tk-dev` package).

        fanning out to that triple's object as its own node, arranged evenly around a circle.
        This is a real, drawn graph -- not GraphDB's own interactive D3 force-graph (see this
        section's own comment above for why not), but genuinely a picture of the graph, not
        text. Every node is filled by its own RDF namespace's color (_node_fill_color()).
        Node/center circle radii (node_r/center_r, below) scale roughly proportionally with
        self._graph_font_size, not by a small fixed add-on -- so a label keeps roughly the same
        amount of room, and wraps onto roughly the same number of lines, at any font size rather
        than the circle staying about the same size while the text inside it keeps growing.

        using that event's own width/height instead of re-querying winfo_width()/winfo_height().
        That distinction matters: querying them via canvas.update_idletasks() from INSIDE a
        <Configure> handler can synchronously re-enter that same handler (Tk processing the very
        geometry event that's still being handled), which used to double up every item this
